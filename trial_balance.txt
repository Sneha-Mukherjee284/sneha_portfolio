2. **Which of the following accounts will appear on a trial balance?**
   a) Sales
   b) Capital
   c) Furniture
   d) All of the above

3. **If the debit side of a trial balance is ₹12,000 and the credit side is ₹11,500, what does it indicate?**

Would you like detailed **solutions** to these, or more questions like these involving journal-to-trial balance conversion or year-end adjustments?

Great! Below are the **answers and explanations** for each of the advanced trial balance questions I shared:

---

### ✅ **Question 1: Error Classification and Rectification**

**1. Wages ₹6,000 paid for construction of a building debited to Wages A/c**

* **Error**: Capital expenditure treated as revenue
* **Rectification Entry**:

  ```
  Building A/c Dr. ₹6,000  
     To Wages A/c ₹6,000  
  ```

  **Effect**: No impact on trial balance (corrects classification only)

**2. Repairs ₹2,500 to machinery debited to Machinery A/c**

* **Error**: Revenue expense treated as capital
* **Rectification Entry**:

  ```
  Repairs A/c Dr. ₹2,500  
     To Machinery A/c ₹2,500  
  ```

  **Effect**: No effect on trial balance total, but corrects classification

**3. ₹1,200 electricity payment omitted**

* **Error**: Complete omission
* **Rectification Entry**:

  ```
  Electricity A/c Dr. ₹1,200  
     To Cash/Bank A/c ₹1,200  
  ```

  **Effect**: Corrects trial balance (both sides were missing ₹1,200)

**4. Credit sale ₹5,000 posted to wrong debtor**

* **Error**: Personal account error
* **Rectification Entry**:

  ```
  Mr. Y A/c Dr. ₹5,000  
     To Mr. X A/c ₹5,000  
  ```

  **Effect**: No impact on trial balance (only individual account correction)

---

### ✅ **Question 2: Adjusted Trial Balance**

**Unadjusted Trial Balance Totals:**

* Dr = ₹125,000
* Cr = ₹125,000

**Adjustments**:

* **Closing stock ₹20,000** → Not recorded yet, shown outside TB or added as adjustment
* **Rent Outstanding ₹2,000** → Add to Rent and create Outstanding Rent (liability)
* **Salaries Prepaid ₹3,000** → Deduct from Salaries and create Prepaid Salaries (asset)

**Adjusted Entries**:

* Rent A/c = ₹12,000 + ₹2,000 = ₹14,000
* Salaries A/c = ₹18,000 – ₹3,000 = ₹15,000
* Prepaid Salaries A/c = ₹3,000 (Dr)
* Outstanding Rent A/c = ₹2,000 (Cr)
* Closing Stock = ₹20,000 (shown in Trading A/c & Balance Sheet, not in TB)

| Account Title       | Dr (₹)      | Cr (₹)      |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Cash                | 10,000      |             |
| Accounts Receivable | 25,000      |             |
| Furniture           | 15,000      |             |
| Purchases           | 45,000      |             |
| Rent                | 14,000      |             |
| Salaries            | 15,000      |             |
| Prepaid Salaries    | 3,000       |             |
| Drawings            | 5,000       |             |
| Outstanding Rent    |             | 2,000       |
| Sales               |             | 80,000      |
| Capital             |             | 35,000      |
| Accounts Payable    |             | 10,000      |
| **Totals**          | **132,000** | **127,000** |

Difference of ₹5,000 is due to **Closing Stock**, which goes to Trading A/c — not trial balance directly.

### ✅ **Question 3: Suspense Account**

Initial Suspense A/c = ₹1,500 (Cr or Dr, depending on TB)

**Rectification Entries:**

1. **Omission of sale ₹3,000 to Mr. Rahul**

   ```
   Rahul A/c Dr. ₹3,000  
      To Sales A/c ₹3,000  
   ```
2. **Purchase ₹1,200 posted as ₹2,100**
   Excess debit of ₹900

   ```
   Suspense A/c Dr. ₹900  
      To Purchases A/c ₹900  
   ```
3. **Creditor paid ₹1,000 posted to debit side** (i.e., double debit)
   Credit missing = ₹2,000

   ```
   Suspense A/c Dr. ₹2,000  
      To Creditors A/c ₹2,000  
   ```
4. **₹500 from debtor wrongly credited to Sales A/c**
   Correct entry: Cash Dr. ₹500, Debtor Cr. ₹500
   Wrong: Sales Cr. ₹500 → Overcredit
   Correction:

   ```
   Sales A/c Dr. ₹500  
      To Suspense A/c ₹500  
   ```

**Suspense A/c**:

| Particulars     | Dr (₹) | Cr (₹) |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Purchases error | 900    |        |
| Creditors error | 2,000  |        |
| Sales error     |        | 500    |
| **Balance c/d** |        | 2,400  |
| **Total**       | 2,900  | 2,900  |

Suspense account closed.

### ✅ **Question 4: Hidden Errors**

Trial Balance Total (Dr):

* Cash: ₹8,000
* Machinery: ₹75,000
* Purchases: ₹65,000
* Rent Paid: ₹12,000
* Debtors: ₹35,000
* Drawings: ₹10,000
* **Total Dr = ₹205,000**

Cr side:

* Capital: ₹100,000
* Sales: ₹130,000
* Commission Received: ₹5,000
* Creditors: ₹20,000
* **Total Cr = ₹255,000**

**Difference = ₹50,000**

**Likely Error**: Sales may have been overstated or Purchases/Debtors understated. Alternatively, a missing account or recording error (e.g., machinery recorded twice or capital understated).
